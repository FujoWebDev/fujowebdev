      <h1>The project</h1>
      <p>
        The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development is a series of zines/books
        featuring anthropomorphized versions of programming languages and
        concepts (aka gijinka), each one engineered from the ground up to cater
        to transformational fandom (that is, people who create fanfictions,
        fanarts, meta, and much more), and their sensibilities and interests.
