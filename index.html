        alt="The logo for The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development. The graphic is aqua, orange, and pink text surrounded by a lavender bubble. Pink hearts bubble up from the word ‘web’ in the title. The word ‘to’ is framed by a terminal. On the left side of the title is a stylized computer screen showing an image of Boba-tan, the BobaBoard Mascot, wearing a raccoon kigurumi, glasses, and waving in greeting."

      <h1>The project</h1>
      <p>
        The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development is a series of zines/books
        featuring anthropomorphized versions of programming languages and
        concepts (aka gijinka), each one engineered from the ground up to cater
        to transformational fandom (that is, people who create fanfictions,
        fanarts, meta, and much more), and their sensibilities and interests.
