The hardest worker in all of Browserland, HTML shows up wherever there's a (web) job to be done. Quiet, dependable, and overworked, he somehow always manages to appear professional.

While he'd much rather spend time scrolling the web and listening to music, he can't help being dragged into CSS and ARIA's neverending shenanigans.
