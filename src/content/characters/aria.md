trivia: While his full name is WAI-ARIA, most refer to him simply as ARIA. Incidentally, it means "air" in Italian.

Born to a rich family, ARIA's life was upended when he was sent to work among Browserland's plebs. Smitten by HTML and his work ethic, he's now his most loyal colleague, and a cup ramen connoisseur.

His constant talking and his intuitive empathy make him the spokesperson of the HTML/CSS/ARIA trio. His generous allowance also bankrolls their adventures.
