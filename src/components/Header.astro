    alt="The logo for The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development. The graphic is aqua, orange, and pink text surrounded by a lavender bubble. Pink hearts bubble up from the word ‘web’ in the title. The word ‘to’ is framed by a terminal. On the left side of the title is a stylized computer screen showing an image of Boba-tan, the BobaBoard Mascot, wearing a raccoon kigurumi, glasses, and waving in greeting."
